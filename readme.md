## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://judo2000.github.io/week2-portfolio/)

This is my professional portfolio for the University of Denver bootcamp homework week 2.

I created the project using html, css, and bootstrap.  I created the header by setting the image I borrowed from the pre-work project as the background image and they put a gradient on top of it.  I added my image and heading.  I built the navigation with bootstrap.  I also using the bootstrap grid system for the main section of the page.

I used semantic to devide up the nav, header, main with sections, and footer of the page.

For the My Work section I create screen shots from 2 projects I have and got another image from [Unsplah.com](https://unsplash.com/).  I set the images as backgrounds with an opacity of .4 and text over the images.  When you mouseover the images the opacity changes from .4 to .7 making the text easier to read.
